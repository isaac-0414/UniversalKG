Arthur Conan Doyle, a famous British author, known for his detective novels featuring Sherlock Holmes, was born in Edinburgh but spent considerable time in London. He was heavily influenced by Edgar Allan Poe, an American author and part of the Romantic Movement, who created the character of detective C. Auguste Dupin. Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, a character with incredible deductive reasoning skills, went onto inspire Agatha Christie's character Hercule Poirot. Despite the fact that Christie was indeed a fan of Doyle's work, she often proclaimed her admiration for Poe's writing style. Interestingly, Christie's novels, like "Murder on the Orient Express" and "Dumb Witness", shared common stylistic patterns and narrative structures with both Doyle and Poe's works. All three, Doyle, Poe, and Christie, left a significant mark on the detective genre of literature, and their writing continues to resonate with audiences worldwide.
